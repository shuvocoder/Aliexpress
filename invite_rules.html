                              1. Invite your friends by giving them your invite link or code.
                              <br><br>
                              2. This program is limited to active AliExpress users and is subject to terms & conditions.
                              <br><br>
                              3. If your friend has never registered with AliExpress before, they are eligible to receive a set of new user coupons once they complete registration.
                              <br><br>
                              4. You will also receive a coupon within 24 hours after your friend completes their first payment.
                              <br><br>
                              5. While there is a limit of 10 coupons per month that you can earn, there is no limit on the number of friends you can invite!
                              <br><br>
                              6. Even if your friend receives several codes or links from different users, they are limited to using 1 code or link only when they register.
                              <br><br><br>
                              7. Important notes
                              <br><br>
                              a) This Game may not be available or has certain restrictions in Special Markets for the reasons of “ship to” settings, technical reasons and differences in local policies. For the avoidance of doubt, “Special Markets” includes, but is not limited to, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
                              <br><br>
                              b) In Special Markets where the Game is available, new users of AliExpress must make a purchase via their account and wait for a few hours before they can play the Game. Such new users cannot directly “share” the Game with their friends either.
                              <br><br>
                              c) The coupons awarded in non-Special Markets shall not be applied to make a purchase in Special Markets and vice versa.
